# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project and analysis is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Task and Approach
To complete this project, I'll create a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. To visulaize this data, I'll place all data points on a map.

I'll be using the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, I'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
